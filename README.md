Overview

The Automation Cooling Fan project aims to showcase the integration of AUTOSAR, a standardized automotive software architecture, into a cooling fan system. This system employs various software components to manage the cooling fan, ensuring effective temperature regulation while adhering to AUTOSAR standards.
Features

    AUTOSAR Integration: Utilizes AUTOSAR-compliant software architecture for the management and control of the cooling fan system.
    Temperature Sensing: Monitors ambient temperature through sensors to regulate the fan speed accordingly.
    Control Algorithms: Implements control algorithms based on temperature inputs for fan speed adjustment.
    Safety Measures: Includes safety protocols to handle exceptional scenarios or failures within the system.
    Adaptability: The system is designed to be adaptable and configurable for different environmental conditions.

Requirements

The project requires the following components and tools:

    AUTOSAR-compliant software environment
    Microcontroller compatible with AUTOSAR
    Temperature sensors
    Cooling fan
